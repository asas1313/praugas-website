    "Process and work-flow improvement\n\nYou need more efficiency of your process? Your work-flow is complex?\nI can analyse, describe and measure your process.\nContinuous improvement Process will reveal improvement ideas. I will look for real added-value of your process. I will also identify non added-value steps or tasks and suggest how to remove them. Hidden-waste will be identify and eliminated.\n\nExamples:  Text or chart in attachment\n\nManufacturing\n- 	Redesign of workshop layout and process steps without investment. Using LEAN approach, surface was reduced to allow new investment installation and new product launch. Stock value and work in progress are decreased.\n- 	Process design using LEAN principle\n- 	Change over time reduction after observation and SMED training (machining, plastic molding, printing)\n- 	Efficiency and quality improvement via observation of down-time and CIP approach.\n\nStock management\n- 	Data analyses\n- 	MRP implementation and optimization\n- 	Hidden-stock tracking\n- 	Identification of ‘dead’ stock\n- 	Decision to remove (sale or scrap)";
